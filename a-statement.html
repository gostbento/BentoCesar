I need a better order tracking and a better journaling of progress. and this both things need to be simultaneous. </p><p>I am studying the best tools to do it. Even making it as a Storefront was an option I've considered using a tool like shopify or woocomerce but right now I have no definitive solution. <br>but I do have pointers</p><p>Notion.so: i think it is terrible because it is too easy to make it too convoluted. <br>Trelllo: Until I find a way to make some part of the process secretive while others not it will be out of the question. <br>A landing page with blogging functions would work great. but it would need a way to make posts secretive. <br>Github would work amazing, if the files I work weren't too big for it to work. <br>all other tools I find too convoluted or hard to use. the best tool so far was a pen and paper agenda, but sharing this with clients is complicated at least</p><p>So far I am still testing. but something have to com from it.
