If you ignore some road-bumps along the way. commissions are neatly delivering what you work on form of money. </p>\n<p>But change is needed and I plan on investing more of my time in things that are not directly tied 1:1 with labour. Like making and selling VRChat avatars/bases and selling Environment models </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/plan2.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan2-xs.png 300w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan2-sm.png 480w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan2-md.png 768w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan2-lg.png 1024w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan2-xl.png 1360w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"360\"></figure>I don't actually plan on abandoning comm work right away. My goal until is to make comms 45%ish of the work I do, and asset (both environment and avatars) the remainder %. </p>\n<p>and I really really hopes this pays out. Because as it is Commissions have a inalienable flaw for me to work on: My ADHD. and communication issues that goes with that. I am fairly decent on communicating in the start but keeping my clients updated tru and tru the process has been an overwhelming issue for me. That I don't see it being easy to solve alone. <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/plan3.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan3-xs.png 300w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan3-sm.png 480w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan3-md.png 768w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan3-lg.png 1024w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan3-xl.png 1360w ,https://gostbento.github.io/BentoCesar/media/posts/4/responsive/plan3-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"360\"></figure>\n<p>But I don't plan to find a work partner anytime soon. and since I got some cushioning in money terms I am moving towards a more Sales based model. <br><br><strong>But what about you my client? </strong></p>\n<p>If you have a commission open nothing will change for you. Absolutely nothing. I will deliver it and that is it. <br>For new commissions there will be some changes. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>First is that I will have a public queue with public updates<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Unless you want your model to be secret to which it will have special terms </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Second my comms openings will be reduced from 5 to 2(or 3) and instead of opening it as soon as I finish an older one. This will be PER month. </li>\n<li>And last, if I eventually find someone to help with this. all commission work will be turn into content. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>My terms and conditions will also be updated. For future models along with the licensing. But I really hope this works out and make for a better work environment. </p>",
